## idea
 - simple website to explain code snippet
 - take code snippet
 - select range of lines --> add some explanation/ comments to it
 - multiple such disjoint ranges of lines can be selected
 - each one will have it's own explanations
 - scroll through explanations --> highlights that specific part
 - provide syntax highlighting for particular languages
 - better UI
 - pastebin ~ similar link creator
