## Installation

### Installing the Kite Engine

The [Kite Engine](https://kite.com/) needs to be installed in order for the package to work properly. The package itself provides the frontend that interfaces with the Kite Engine, which performs all the code analysis and machine learning 100% locally on your computer (no code is sent to a cloud server).

__macOS Instructions__
1. Download the [installer](https://kite.com/download/?utm_source=sublime-github) and open the
downloaded `.dmg` file.
2. Drag the Kite icon into the `Applications` folder.
3. Run `Kite.app` to start the Kite Engine.

__Windows Instructions__
1. Download the [installer](https://kite.com/download/?utm_source=sublime-github) and run the
downloaded `.exe` file.
2. The installer should run the Kite Engine automatically after installation is complete.

__Linux Instructions__
1. View [our instructions](https://kite.com/linux/?utm_source=sublime-github) for installing Kite.
2. The installer should run the Kite Engine automatically after installation is complete.

### Installing the Kite Plugin for Sublime

When running the Kite Engine for the first time, you'll be guided through a setup process which will allow you to install
the Sublime package. You can also install or uninstall the Sublime package at any time using the Kite Engine's [plugin
manager](https://help.kite.com/article/62-managing-editor-plugins).

Alternatively, you can `git clone` this repository directly into your Sublime `Packages` directory. You can locate your
`Packages` directory by opening Sublime, clicking on the `Preferences` menu item, then selecting `Browse Packages...`.

## Usage

The following is a brief guide to using Kite in its default configuration.

### Autocompletions

Simply start typing in a saved Python or JavaScript file and Kite will automatically suggest completions for what you're typing.

### Hover (Python only)

Hover your mouse cursor over a symbol to view a short summary of what the symbol represents.

![hover](https://github.com/kiteco/KiteSublime/blob/master/docs/assets/hover.png?raw=true)

If the built-in `show_definition` preference is enabled, Kite will show you the definitions and references found in the
Sublime index as usual.

![hover-show-definition](https://github.com/kiteco/KiteSublime/blob/master/docs/assets/hover-show-definition.png?raw=true)

### Documentation (Python only)

Click on the `Docs` link in the hover popup to open the documentation for the symbol inside the [Copilot](https://kite.com/copilot/), Kite's desktop app for Python documentation (JavaScript documentation not yet available). The Copilot's search results also follow your cursor as you type.

### Definitions (Python only)

If a `Def` link is available in the hover popup, clicking on it will jump to the definition of the symbol.

### Function Signatures (Python only)

When you call a function in Python, Kite will show you the arguments required to call it.

![signatures](https://github.com/kiteco/KiteSublime/blob/master/docs/assets/signatures.png?raw=true)

Kite also shows you `How others used this` function, which are the most popular calling patterns inferred from all the
open-source Python code on the internet.

### Commands and Keyboard Shortcuts

In case you prefer to not use the mouse, most of Kite's features can be triggered from the command palette.

![commands](https://github.com/kiteco/KiteSublime/blob/master/docs/assets/commands.png?raw=true)

Furthermore, Kite comes with the following default keyboard shortcuts:

|Command|Shortcut|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`H`over|`ctrl`+`alt`+`h`|Show the hover popup at your current cursor position|
|`D`ocumentation|`ctrl`+`alt`+`d`|Show documentation in the Copilot|
|F`u`nction Signatures|`ctrl`+`alt`+`u`|Show the function signature panel|
|Ke`y`word Arguments|`ctrl`+`alt`+`y`|Show/hide keyword arguments (when function signature panel is shown)|
|Popula`r` Patterns|`ctrl`+`alt`+`r`|Show/hide popular calling patterns (when function signature panel is shown)|


## Configuration

You can change Kite's settings by clicking on `Preferences`, then `Package Settings`, then `Kite`. Alternatively, you can
access the preferences files from the command palette using `Kite: Package Settings`. The default preferences file should
be self documenting.

## Known Issues

* On Sublime 3200+, the function signature UI is truncated in some situations. ([Issue]( https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/2711))
