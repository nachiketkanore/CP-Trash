1)You are given an Array of N positive intergers. Your task is to convert this array into a gifted array in minimum number of steps. Gifted array is defined as an array in which each index i in range (2 <= i <= N). satisfies the condition A[i] â€” A[i-1] = 1. In one step you can select any index and either increase or decrease the value at the selected index by 1.

Note : You aren't allowed to rearrange the order of elements in the array.

input: an integer N then n numbers

constraint: 1 <= N <=10^5 1 <= A[i] <= 10^5

6 13 17 13 6 11 11

output 6+9+4+4+0+1 = 24

5 3 2 5 4 6

output 8

5 9 11 15 25 21

output = 20
