```bash
CHARVER O(M * N^3) won't work
Need to do some manipulation with equations
MEXPROB may require some data structure
We could binary search on the answer
Let if x is the answer, then x is the largest value such that
number of subarrays with mex <= x is <= k
find largest x s.t number of subarrays with mex <= x is <= k
```
