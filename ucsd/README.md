## Case 1: Union of selected intervals might not be a single interval

First of all, sort the intervals in increasing order of $I_i.start$

Use the following Dynamic Programming solution:


$$
\mathrm dp(i, j, k) = max(
 \text{extend_union} + dp(i + 1, jâ€™, k - 1), dp(i + 1, j, k) )
$$

where
$$
\mathrm j' = \begin{cases}
    i & \text{if } I_i.end > I_j.end \\ % & is your "\tab"-like command (it's a tab alignment character)
    j & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$
$$
\mathrm extend\_union = \begin{cases}
    max(0, I_i.end - I_j.end) & \text{if } I_j \text{ intersects }I_i \\ % & is your "\tab"-like command (it's a tab alignment character)
    I_i.end - I_i.start & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$


- $dp(i, j, k)$ denotes the maximum sum of lengths of the segments in the
range the $[i, N)$

- $j$ is the range $I_j$ such that $I_j.end$ is the maximum among all the segments that we chose until now
- $k$ denotes how many more segments are left to choose.

We have 2 choices at each state
- **Choice 1**: Consider the interval $I_i$ in our subset.
In this case, the union length will increase by the amount $\text{extend_union}$ as mentioned above

- **Choice 2**: Don't consider the interval $I_i$ in our subset.
In this case, the union length will not increase

- If you have reached, with $i=N$ and $k=0$, return $0$ else $-\infty$

- **Time Complexity**: $O(N^2K)$

 ## Case 2:  Union of selected intervals should be a single interval

First of all, sort the intervals in increasing order of $I_i.start$

1. Now, create a graph of $N$ nodes such that for every $i$, there an edge from $i$ to $j$ such that
$j = \underset{j}{\operatorname{argmax}} I_j.end$ where $I_i  \bigcap I_j \neq \phi$.

Don't add an edge if such $j$ doesn't exist

This $j$ can be found out using any range querying data structure like segment trees in $O(log(N))$  or in $O(1)$  with sparse tables and precomputations

This will add $O(N)$ edges in the graph

2. The resulting graph will be a **DAG**, with at most one path between any pairs of nodes $i$ to $j$
3. It will be similar to this:

4. Now, if we choose any starting node in this graph and traverse $K$ nodes to the right, we will end with the most optimal subset of size $K$ having a certain union length. We can use this to maximize the answer
5. It may happen that there are $M < K$ nodes to traverse, in that case, we can consider this subset only if there are $K-M$ other intervals that lie within this union.

Finding these $K-M$ **other intervals** may take $O(N)$ time in the worst case

To speed this up, the following observations are helpful:
[![image 2][2]][2]

From the image above, if number of **x** segments + number of **y** segments is $\geq K-M$, this subset can be consider in our answer

- Let $l$ be the index of starting interval of our subset and $r$ be the index where we end up in this case
- Notice that number of **x** segments is simply $(r - l + 1) - M$, computing in $O(1)$ time
To find the number of **y** segments, we can use binary search to find the rightmost index $id$ in the range $[r+1, N]$ and  $I_{id}$ lies within $I_r$
- Then the number of **y** segments is simply $id - r$, computed in $O(log(N))$ time
- We can use the binary search here because the interval $I_r$ can no longer extend further and the ranges after that will lie completely within the interval $I_r$ or start anywhere $> I_r.start$
If that is the case we can update the answer with the union length of this subset

6. Considering every interval as the starting point of the subset and traversing $K$ nodes each time will result in $O(N*K$) time
7. To optimize it further, notice that we only require the starting and ending indices and not the entire subset indices. Furthermore, nodes chosen by a subset can be reused by other subsets based on their connectivity in the DAG that we defined above
8. Instead of adding the edges from $i$ to $j$, we keep them from $j$ to $i$. This is because the resultant disjoint trees formed will have their roots(nodes that don't go further) to the right. The following diagram depicts what we are doing:
[![image 3][3]][3]
9. DFS on nodes indexed from $N$ to $1$ and keep a list of nodes that are the nodes traversed from root to this node.

 This will help us finding the $K^{th}$ node from each node in every DFS call in $O(1)$ time

 Update the answer for each DFS($u$) call considering $u$ as the starting interval of the chosen subset

- **Pseudo Code**
```python
answer = 0
parents = []
visited = [false] * N

function update_answer(starting_point):
	# update answer
	# based on the conditions
	# mentioned above

function dfs(u):
	parents.add(u)
	update_answer(u)
	visited[u] = true
	for each neighbor v of u:
		dfs(v)
	parents.pop(u)

for i = N to 1:
	if not visited[i]:
		dfs(i)

print(answer)
```
